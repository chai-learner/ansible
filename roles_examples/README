to run the nginx_role.yaml

we need to have the nginx role already installed in our host machine, if not installed please run the below command
$$ ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy-nginx

we have created a custom role in roles folder and we are calling it in custom_role_call.yaml 

we can also make a requirements (set of roles) to download and we can do it at one go.
  to deonstrate it we have created rolesone folder and requirements.yaml file
  $$ ansible-galaxy install -r rolesone/requirements.yaml -p rolesone/
