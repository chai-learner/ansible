  $$ ansible-vault create secret.yaml
it will prompt for a password we have to give any password and save the same in vault.pass file
in the secret file we have to pass variables 
  username: chai
  pwhash: password

then we have to run the below command to run the playbook
  $$ ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=vault.pass create_user.yaml
